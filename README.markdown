# jQuery Waypoints

Waypoints is a jQuery plugin that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element.

```js
$('.thing').waypoint(function() {
  alert('You have scrolled to a thing.');
});
```
If you're new to Waypoints, check out the [Get Started](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#get-started) section.

[Read the full documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#docs) for more details on usage and customization.

## Use

If you're using bower you can run:

```sh
$ bower install jquery-waypoints
```

## Shortcuts

In addition to the normal Waypoints script, extensions exist to make common UI patterns just a little easier to implement:

- [Infinite Scrolling](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll)
- [Sticky Elements](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements)

## Examples

Waypoints can also be used as a base for your own custom UI patterns. Here are a few examples:

- [Scroll Analytics](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/scroll-analytics)
- [Dial Controls](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/dial-controls)

## AMD Module Loader Support

If you're using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), Waypoints registers itself as a named module, `'waypoints'`. Shortcut scripts are anonymous modules.

## Development Environment

If you want to contribute to Waypoints, I love pull requests that include changes to the source `coffee` files as well as the compiled JS and minified files. You can set up the same environment by running `make setup` (which just aliases to `npm install`). This will install the version of CoffeeScript and UglifyJS that I'm using. From there, running `make build` will compile and minify all the necessary files. Test coffee files are compiled on the fly, so compile and minify do not apply to those files.

## Support

Unit tests for Waypoints are written with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [jasmine-jquery](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery).  You can [run them here](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/test/). If any of the tests fail, please open an issue and include the browser used, operating system, and description of the failed test.
