# Waypoints

Waypoints is a library that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imakewebthings/waypoints.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/imakewebthings/waypoints)

```js
var waypoint = new Waypoint({
  element: document.getElementById('thing'),
  handler: function(direction) {
    alert('You have scrolled to a thing')
  }
})
```

If you're new to Waypoints, check out the [Getting Started](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started) guide.

[Read the full documentation](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/waypoint) for more details on usage and customization.

## Shortcuts

In addition to the normal Waypoints script, extensions exist to make common UI patterns just a little easier to implement:

- [Infinite Scrolling](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll)
- [Sticky Elements](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements)
- [Inview Detection](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/inview)
