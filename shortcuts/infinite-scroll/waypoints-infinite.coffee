###
# An extension of the waypoint defaults when calling the "infinite" method.

# - container: Selector that matches a container around the items that are
#   infinitely loaded. Newly loaded items will be appended to this container.
#   If this value is set to 'auto' as it is by default, the container will be
#   the element .waypoint is called on.

# - items: Selector that matches the items to pull from each AJAX loaded
#   page and append to the "container".

# - more: Selector that matches the next-page link. The href attribute of
#   this anchor is AJAX loaded and harvested for new items and a new "more"
#   link during each waypoint trigger.

# - offset: The same as the base waypoint offset. But in this case, we use
#   bottom-in-view as the default instead of 0.

# - loadingClass: This class is added to the container while new items are
#   being loaded, and removed once they are loaded and appended.

# - onBeforePageLoad: A callback function that is executed at the beginning
#   of a page load trigger, before the AJAX request is sent.

# - onAfterPageLoad: A callback function that is executed at the end of a new
#   page load, after new items have been appended.

	# The infinite method is a shortcut method for a common UI pattern, infinite
	# scrolling. This turns a traditional More/Next-Page style pagination into
	# an infinite scrolling page. The recommended usage is to call this method
	# on the container holding the items to be loaded. Ex:

	# $('.infinite-container').waypoint('infinite');

	# Using all of the default options, when the bottom of the infinite container
	# comes into view, a new page of items will be loaded. The script will look
	# for a link with the class of "infinite-more-link", grab its href attribute,
	# and load that page with AJAX. It will then search for all items in this new
	# page with a class of "infinite-item" and will append them to the
	# "infinite-container". The "infinite-more-link" item is also replaced with
	# the more link from the new page, allowing the next trigger to load the next
	# page. This continues until no new more link is detected in the loaded page.

	# An options object can optionally be passed in to override any of the
	# defaults specified above, as well as the baseline waypoint defaults.
