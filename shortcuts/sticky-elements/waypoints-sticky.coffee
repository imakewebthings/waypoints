  # An extension of the waypoint defaults when calling the "sticky" method.

  # - wrapper: Each sticky element gets wrapped in another element. This
  #   element acts as the actual waypoint and stays in the document flow,
  #   leaving the sticky element to gain/lost fixed positioning freely without
  #   effecting layout. "wrapper" is the HTML for this element.

  # - stuckClass: The class that is added to the sticky element when the
  #   waypoint is reached. Users should style this class to add fixed
  #   positioning and whatever other styles are necessary for their
  #   particular design.

  # The sticky method is a shortcut method for a common UI pattern, sticky
  # elements. In its most common form, this pattern consists of an item that
  # is part of the normal document flow until it reaches the top of the
  # viewport, where it gains a fixed position state.

  # This shortcut does very little to actually create the sticky state. It only
  # adds a class to the element when it reaches the appropriate part of the
  # viewport. It is the job of the user to define the styles for this "stuck"
  # state in CSS. There are many different ways one could style their sticky
  # elements, and trying to implement all of them in JS is futile. Everyone's
  # design is different.

  # This shortcut does take care of the most common pitfall in previous
  # versions of Waypoints: Using the sticky element as the waypoint. Fixed
  # position elements do not work well as waypoints since their position in
  # the document is constantly changing as the user scrolls (and their
  # position relative to the viewport never does, which is the whole point of
  # Waypoints). This shortcut will create a wrapper element around the sticky
  # element that acts as the actual waypoint, as well as a placeholder for the
  # waypoint in the document flow, as fixed positioning takes an element out
  # of flow and would otherwise effect the page layout. Users are recommended
  # to define any margins on their sticky elements as margins on this
  # wrapper instead.
